## About me

---

I'm a technical communicator living in Zurich, Switzerland.

I create software documentation. Great software is not complete without great documentation. This is why docs are an important contributor to the DevOps lifecycle, and why they should come about from the same processes generating great code. As such, I use [*docs-as-code*](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) practices. I'm tool-agnostic; I choose tools to fit each job.

I also create business documentation such as procedures and training resources.

My personal philosophy as a technical communicator is to make it my job to master a body of knowledge, to understand my audience(s), and to discern how to structure and present this information in the most user-friendly manner possible. I wholeheartedly believe that the best docs are living docs and that continuous improvement is always possible through iteration.

I used to run the communications department for a medical non-transplant tissue bank. Before that, I taught philosophy at the University of Oklahoma. See my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/casey-stull) for more.

### Why technical communications?  

My introduction into technical communications was a happy accident. A spontaneous project prompted me to research current standards for software documentation. Creating documentation where none existed before turned out to be quite rewarding.

Since then, the choice to pursue technical communications has been easy. Technical communications combines learning new subjects with using hard-gained skills in communications and writing to teach and inform.

Below you'll find four things which fuel my love for technical communications: curiosity, teaching, writing, and tech.

I'm at my best when my curiosity is fed. This is part of why I pursued philosophy for much of my career. Technical communications gives me free rein to dive deep and learn subjects methodically and thoroughly. Mastering bodies of knowledge is incredibly rewarding.

I first started teaching at the age of 14, when I taught private lessons on drumset. Since then I've taught many subjects in different settings, including teaching philosophy at the University of Oklahoma for six years. I love teaching since it reinforces learning; when you have to teach a subject you quickly realize your own inadequacies in understanding. And sharing knowledge is always good.

I've loved reading and writing since a young age and have written extensively including: fiction, journaling, marketing copy for varied channels, academic articles, and most notably for teaching purposes. I love crafting the written word and structuring information to be readable and enlightening.

Tech fascinates me for several reasons. One is that, as a tool, modern technology is diverse, adaptable, and empowers common people to do great things. Another is the plethora of communities arising out of tech. I see open-source communities building great things, and people banding together to help one another. This is inspirational to me.

## About me

---

I'm a technical communicator living in Zurich, Switzerland.

I create software documentation. I use *Docs-as-Code* practices and choose tools to fit each job. I also create business documentation such as procedures, SOPs, and training resources.

I used to do communications for a medical non-transplant tissue bank. Before that, I taught philosophy at the University of Oklahoma. See my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/casey-stull) for more.

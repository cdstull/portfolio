## About me

---

I'm a technical communicator living in Zurich, Switzerland.

I create software documentation. Great software is not complete without great documentation. This is why docs are an important contributor to the DevOps lifecycle, and why they should come about from the same processes generating great code. As such, I use [*docs-as-code*](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) practices. I'm tool-agnostic; I choose tools to fit each job.

I also create business documentation such as procedures and training resources.

My personal philosophy as a technical communicator is to make it my job to master a body of knowledge, to understand my audience(s), and to discern how to structure and present this information in the most user-friendly manner possible. I wholeheartedly believe that the best docs are living docs and that continuous improvement is always possible through iteration.

I used to run the communications department for a medical non-transplant tissue bank. Before that, I taught philosophy at the University of Oklahoma. See my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/casey-stull) for more.

### Why technical communications?  

My introduction into technical communications was a happy accident. A spontaneous project prompted me to research current standards for software documentation. Creating documentation where none existed before turned out to be quite rewarding.

Since then, the choice to pursue technical communications has been easy. Technical communications combines learning new subjects with using hard-gained skills in communications and writing to teach and inform.

My love for technical communications is fueled by curiosity, teaching, writing, and tech.

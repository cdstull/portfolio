## Instructional Job Aids for Custom-Configured Hiring Platform ([Greenhouse](https://www.greenhouse.io/))

---  

An HR consultant needed quick help with a large Pharmaceutical client. Moving to a new digital platform forced extensive changes to internal hiring workflows. These changes affected teams involved in the hiring process.

My client needed initial training material to ease the team into new workflows. I created a series of slides as reference material. Together the slides formed an opening presentation for the team. Apart the slides became printable job aids for quick reference.

Slides include step-by-step instructions for workflows. Others include maps to familiarize users with proprietary dashboard configuration.

The scope comprised about 15 work tasks across six teams. The entire project required rapid turnaround and was completed in less than a week.

You can see a [sample](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1snvDOHgzZ-l3_TBgRIxbF5C_06rFAw5t8s8I1d9KEps/edit?usp=sharing) of the procedural job aids in this Google Doc, modified to scrub proprietary formatting and client details.

## Instructional Job Aids for Custom-Configured Hiring Platform (Greenhouse)
---  

An HR consultant needed quick help with a large Pharmaceutical client. Moving to a new digital platform forced extensive changes to internal hiring workflows.

My client needed initial training material to ease the team into new workflows. I created a series of slides as reference material. Together the slides formed an opening presentation for the team. Apart the slides became printable job aids for quick reference.

Slides include step-by-step instructions for workflows. Some also include maps to familiarize users with proprietary dashboard configuration.

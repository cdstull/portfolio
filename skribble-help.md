## Help Center for Web Application ([Skribble](https://www.skribble.com/))

---  

Skribble is a software startup based in Zurich. They offer a web application for legally-binding e-signatures.

Customers went to the help center but struggled to find answers to their problems. This increased the need for employee intervention and sapped company resources. The client wished to remain on the Hubspot platform but needed a transformation.

I wrote a new table of contents containing every task a user might want to complete on the platform. I also changed the phrasing of titles from an FAQ-style to a manual-style. This reduced the average article title length from ten or more words to two. This made the guide more scannable so users can locate what they need.

I wrote all articles fresh without reference to the previous help center content. The new format offers a streamlined approach for user self-help.

The Skribble [help center](https://help.skribble.com/english) is currently being localized.

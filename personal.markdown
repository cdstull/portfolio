I'm from Kansas City, MO, in the U.S. After spending my life in the middle of the U.S. I moved to Zurich to be with my wife. We have two kids.

In my free time I like to read a broad range of non-fiction as well as science-fiction and fantasy. I like cooking and I especially love fermenting foods. I've made kimchis, saurkrauts, many pickles, and kombucha.

I do Pilates and I lift weights. I also love urban exploration.

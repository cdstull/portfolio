## User Guide for Web Application (Skribble)
---  


Skribble is a software startup based in Zurich. They offer a web application for legally-binding e-signatures.  

Large corporate clients needed to onboard employees but only rudimentary documentation existed. I created a task-based user guide for admin users. The guide offers detailed steps for every task an admin user might want to complete on the platform.  

Building with Sphinx, a static site generator, offers reliability and scalability. Version-controlling with Git ensures clarity for the team. The user guide provides a concrete solution to pain points of new clients. It also offers a new selling point for the platform.
